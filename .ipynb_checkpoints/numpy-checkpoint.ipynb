    "#### Scalars\n",
    "Scalars in NumPy are a bit more involved than in Python. Instead of Python’s basic types like int, float, etc., NumPy lets you specify signed and unsigned types, as well as different sizes. So instead of Python’s int, you have access to types like uint8, int8, uint16, int16, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "These types are important because every object you make (vectors, matrices, tensors) eventually stores scalars. And when you create a NumPy array, you can specify the type - but every item in the array must have the same type. In this regard, NumPy arrays are more like C arrays than Python lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to create a NumPy array that holds a scalar, you do so by passing the value to NumPy's array function, like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>s = np.array(5)</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "You can still perform math between ndarrays, NumPy scalars, and normal Python scalars, though, as you'll see in the element-wise math lesson."
